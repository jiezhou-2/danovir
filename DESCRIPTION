Title: Denoised Analysis of Vaccine-induced Immune Response
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jie Zhou
Maintainer: Jie Zhou <chowstat@gmail.com>
Description: In many vaccine studies, due to the concern of safety, 
    the sample size is very low. At the meanwhile, the data demonstrate high variation. Under such condition, 
    selecting significant treatment effects from a range of antigen-antibody compound is difficult.
    This pacakge uses denoised model coupled with random effects to improve the estimates of treatment.
